When you **add** always shoose files or simple write a dot (.) which stands for all files in the directory
When you **commit** add '-m Your message' which will appear as a header in github 
When you **push** add 'origin ChosenBranch' when it is your first time pushing. Next times it is as simple as 'git push'. Then your changes will be visible on you github
## Checking differences between versions
*git diff
It is important to write which versions to compare, e.g 'git diff main..OtherBranch'
## Adding new branch 
*git branch NameOfBranch
*git checkout NameofBranch
*git merge
'git branch' creates a new branch, 'git checkout' changes to the branch and 'git merge' if you want to change main with the new branch
